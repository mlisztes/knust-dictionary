This is because the largest possible degree of rotation of the arm is not more than 270 degrees (3/4 turn) from the most inwardly rotated to the most outwardly rotated position. Therefore, the direction sign above a sign for a plane or edge determines the direction of the rotation as well as its degree. It is difficult to define in each arm position the exact direction of the palm in the normal untwisted state of the arm (one must rely on the body feeling of what is naturally relaxed).

Because there are other conditions governing it, the movement score (902b) cannot be planned in the same way as a music score, in which the same staff is usually reserved for the same instrument or voice throughout.

In most cases many of the preliminary indications can be omitted below the retention staff, with the exception of the indications of the people concerned, which are necessary so that one can always see who is on stage. A word description of the pantomime movements of some or all of the people who are not actually dancing can be written in the retention staff. If a soloist or a group takes an active part again, a new staff branches off from the retention staff. This new staff must have a starting position graph as well as the other usual preliminary indications.
