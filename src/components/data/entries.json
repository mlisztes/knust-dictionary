This is because the largest possible degree of rotation of the arm is not more than 270 degrees (3/4 turn) from the most inwardly rotated to the most outwardly rotated position. Therefore, the direction sign above a sign for a plane or edge determines the direction of the rotation as well as its degree. It is difficult to define in each arm position the exact direction of the palm in the normal untwisted state of the arm (one must rely on the body feeling of what is naturally relaxed).

A word description of the pantomime movements of some or all of the people who are not actually dancing can be written in the retention staff.
